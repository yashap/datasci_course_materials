What is Pig?
- an engine for executing programs on top of Hadoop
- provides a language, Pig Latin, to specify these programs
- will generate a sequence of MR jobs

Why use Pig?
- Why not just write the raw MR?
- Example:
	- we have user data in one file
	- website data in another
	- want TOP 5 MOST VISITED SITES BY USERS AGED 18-25
- Would need to
	- Load users, then filter by age
	- Load pages
	- Join users/pages on name
	- Group on URL
	- Order by clicks
	- Take top 5
- ~170 lines of MR code to do this! (~4 hrs to write)
- In Pig Latin, 9 lines of code (~10 mins to write)
- Here's what it looks like in Pig:

-- Load user data based on specific schema
Users = load 'users' as (name, age);
-- Filter it
Fltrd = filter Users by age >= 18 and age <= 25;

-- Load pages data based on specific schema
Users = load 'pages' as (user, url);

-- Join
Jnd = join Fltrd by name, Pages by user;
-- Group
Grpd = group Jnd by url;
-- 
Smmd = foreach Grpd generate group, COUNT(Jnd) as clicks;
Strd = order Smmd by clicks desc;
Top5 = limit Strd 5;
store Top5 into 'top5sites';
