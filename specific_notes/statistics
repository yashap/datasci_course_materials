Statistical inference
	- methods for drawing conclusions about a population from sample data
	- 2 key methods:
		- hypothesis test
			- compare experimental and control groups
			- null hypothesis (HO) = no difference
			- alternative hypoth (HA) = statistically signif diff
			- careful experimental design most important
				- randomized trials
				- blinded/double blinded
			- BUT in data science we often can't do experiments
			- ERRORS:
				- HO is true, BUT reject HO --> type 1 error (rate that this happens is alpha)
				- HO is false, BUT don't reject HO --> type 2 error (rate that this happens is beta)
				- the power of a test is 1 - beta (type 2 error)
					- this is your ability to reject a false null hypothesis
		- confidence interval
